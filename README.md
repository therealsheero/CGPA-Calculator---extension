## 📘 CGPA / GPA Calculation & Conversion Formulas

### 🔟 10-Point CGPA Calculation

**Formula:**
CGPA (10-point) = (Σ (Grade Point × Credit)) / (Σ Credits)

**Example:**
Subjects:

* Sub1: Grade = A (9), Credit = 4
* Sub2: Grade = B+ (8), Credit = 3
* Sub3: Grade = A+ (10), Credit = 3

CGPA = \[(9×4) + (8×3) + (10×3)] / (4+3+3)
\= (36 + 24 + 30) / 10 = 90 / 10 = **9.0**

---

### US 4-Point GPA Calculation

**Formula:**
GPA (4-point) = (Σ (Grade Point × Credit)) / (Σ Credits)

**Example:**
Subjects:

* Sub1: Grade = A (4.0), Credit = 3
* Sub2: Grade = B+ (3.3), Credit = 3
* Sub3: Grade = C (2.0), Credit = 4

GPA = \[(4.0×3) + (3.3×3) + (2.0×4)] / (3+3+4)
\= (12 + 9.9 + 8) / 10 = 29.9 / 10 = **2.99**

---

### 📊 Weighted Average Percentage

**Formula:**
Weighted Percentage = (Σ (Marks × Credit)) / (Σ Credits)

**Example:**
Subjects:

* Sub1: Marks = 85, Credit = 4
* Sub2: Marks = 78, Credit = 3
* Sub3: Marks = 90, Credit = 3

Weighted % = \[(85×4) + (78×3) + (90×3)] / (4+3+3)
\= (340 + 234 + 270) / 10 = 844 / 10 = **84.4%**

---

### 🔁 Convert 10-Point CGPA to Percentage

**Formula:**
Percentage = CGPA × 9.5

**Example:**
If CGPA = 8.5
Percentage = 8.5 × 9.5 = **80.75%**

---

### 🔁 Convert 4-Point GPA to Percentage

**Formula (India Standard):**
Percentage = (GPA / 4) * 100

**Example:**
If GPA = 3.2
Percentage = (3.2/4)*100 = **80%**
